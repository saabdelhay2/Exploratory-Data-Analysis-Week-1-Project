  2- plot1.R and plot1.png: code to produce a histogram for Global_Active_Power and save it in plot1.png
  
  3- plot2.R and plot2.png: code to produce a scatterplot for Global_Active_Power and save it in plot2.png
  
  4- plot3.R and plot3.png: code to produce a scatter plot for Submetering_1, Submetering_2 and Submetering_3, together with a legend,
  
  and save the plot in plot.png
  
  5- plot5.R and plot4.png: code to produce the following four plots arrange by par(mfrow = c(2, 2)):
  
    a- Global Active Power
    
    b- Voltage
    
    c- Energy Submetering
    
    d- Global Reactive Power
    
  The plots are save in plot4.png.
